Day 3
I have built a library management system with book,user and library as the classes.
The users can add a new book,borrow a book,return the borrowed book and view the title and status of all books.
The system handles all boundary cases and displays error messages in situations such as book not existing in the library,book already borrowed and trying to return a book borrowed by someone else.
The program is menu driven.
